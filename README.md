# Tissue-Analysis
Background:

Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells are synthetic and modular proteins used to target highly cytotoxic T cells to specific target proteins.

When used in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma they target CD19, a transmembrane protein expressed on all B cell lineages.

We are asking: 
- What explains the different responses to CAR-T therapy? 
-Which patients are most liekly to have an intiial or complete response to CAR-T? Why?
-Of those patients who initially have a complete response, which are most likely to ultimately have progression of disease? Why?

Aims: 
- Identify transcriptional signatures in pre-CAR T treatment tumor biopsies which correlate with a durable response at 6 months

- Compare the differences in the spatial organization of cell types and transcriptional signatures between responders and non-responders
